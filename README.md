# TaskTracker
This is a React App Task Tracker built following a tutorial by Traversy Media's youtube channel.  It can be viewed here https://laurielonecrow.github.io/TaskTracker/.  The app is functional but does not have a proper backend to store any new data.  That will be something that I add later. After working more with React, I realize how much I love it.
