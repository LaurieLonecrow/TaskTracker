# TaskTracker
This is a React App Task Tracker built following a tutorial by Traversy Media's youtube channel.  It can be viewed here: https://laurielonecrow.github.io/TaskTracker/
At this point it does not have a functional backend to store information.  I may add that in the future.  This was an excercise in creating a React App, and deploying it on GitHub.
I really enjoy working with React.
